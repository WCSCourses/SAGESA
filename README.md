## About SAGESA

The [SAGESA project](https://sagesa.africa) established a research and training network, as an important step in building capacity for pathogen genomics and surveillance of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in Africa. The SAGESA project is funded by the [Cambridge Africa ALBORADA Research Fund](https://www.cambridge-africa.cam.ac.uk/initiatives/the-alborada-research-fund/), and is a collaboration by scientists from the [National Institute of Communicable Diseases](https://www.nicd.ac.za) in South Africa, the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, [University of Zimbabwe](http://www.uz.ac.zw/index.php/university-departments), [Wellcome Connecting Science](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomeconnectingscience.org)and the [Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net).
