## About SAGESA

The SAGESA project established a research and training network, as an important step in building capacity for pathogen genomics and surveillance of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in Africa. The SAGESA project is funded by the Cambridge Africa ALBORADA Research Fund, and is a collaboration by scientists from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa, the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Zimbabwe, Wellcome Connecting Science and the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, UK.
